# Darktable XMP Sync Tool

A desktop application for synchronizing darktable XMP files between different
machines running different darktable instances.

This enables a simpler setup than trying to keep the two databases in sync.

## Features

- **XMP Diff Analysis**: Compares darktable XMP files between working and reference directories
- **Visual comparison**: Generates previews for all pairs of differing XMPs via `darktable-cli`
- **Keyboard-Only Navigation**: Designed for efficient keyboard-only workflow
- **Batch Operations**: Go through the files and decide which ones to keep, then execute all operations at once.
- **Edit in darktable**: For difficult cases, allows you to open the two copies in
darktable for fine inspection and possibly further editing.

## ⚠️ Early Development Stage

This application is in very early development and may have bugs or incomplete features. Use with caution on production workflows.

## A note on code quality

I started developing this app as an experiment in agent-assisted coding. The code has been almost completely generated by Gemini 2.5 Pro and Claude Sonnet 4, and I haven't fully inspected it.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Darktable (and `darktable-cli`) are installed on your system.
- Python 3.9+
- PySide6 (Qt for Python)
- lxml (XML processing)

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install PySide6 lxml
```

## Usage

### Running from sources

```bash
python3 src/dtsync/main.py
```

### Basic Workflow

1. **Configure**: Set path to `darktable-cli` and other options
   (e.g., preview size, number of threads)
   [only necessary on first run]
2. **Chose Archive and Session directories**: in the main app
   window. These should be two directories with the same
   sub-directory structure.
3. **Scan**: Click the "Scan" buitton to recursively find XMP
   files with differences in the two directories.
5. **Cull/Decide**: Choose actions for each file (keep archive,
   keep session, keep both)
6. **Apply changes**: Click on "Execute planned actions" to
   enforce the decisions that you have taken.
   Deselect the "dry-run" toggle if you want the changes to be
   applied for real.

See `USAGE.md` for more details.

### Keyboard Navigation

If you want, during the culling phase you can use the application
without taking your hands away from the keyboard. The default
shortcuts are designed for QWERTY layouts. If they don't work
for you, you can configure them in the preferences:

- **Up/Down**: Navigate up/down through file list
- **Left/Right**: Navigate to previous/next undecided file
- **1**: Keep reference version
- **2**: Keep both versions  
- **3**: Keep working version
- **`** (backtick): Reset to no action
- **E/Q**: Zoom in/out on previews
- **W/A/S/D**: Scroll preview images
- **R**: Toggle preview orientation

## Troubleshooting

- **No previews**: Check darktable-cli path in settings
- **Slow scanning**: Reduce thread count or preview size
- **Memory issues**: Clear preview cache or reduce preview dimensions
